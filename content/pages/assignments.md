There will be 4 problem sets total, each with 2–3 weeks to complete them. We anticipate some problems being challenging and advise students to start thinking about the problems early. Solutions will be posted here after the due date; for this reason, late days are not allowed.

Submissions must made electronically, and consist of a single PDF document. Answers must be clearly written and formatted. We will deduct points if your solutions are hard to read or poorly formatted. We strongly encourage the use of LaTeX for written / math parts of your answers. Microsoft Word 2013 and Google Docs also have reasonable math support. If you are unfamiliar with LaTeX, start with ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[this good introduction (PDF - 1.7MB)](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf). You can use [this LaTeX template](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.890/fall14/psets/hw-template.tex). You may scan your figures, or entire solutions if your handwriting is clear. To draw figures electronically, we recommend [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/en/) or (for the more coding minded) [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/).

Solutions do not need to include all calculations, trivial details etc. Just prove to us that you found the solution, and you understand it well. You may discuss assigned problems with other students, but must write your solution individually. Be sure to cite all collaborators and any sources you use. Avoid reading sources that solve the problem, but if you accidentally do, cite that source.

Problems will be graded with the following marks:

*   X = 0/10: You didn't get it. The answer is completely wrong or doesn't address the question. Please don't write stuff you know is wrong.
*   Check minus = 6/10: Your solution had a good concept, but the write-up contained significant errors or omissions.
*   Check = 8/10: Your solution was essentially correct but contained minor errors or omissions.
*   Check plus = 10/10: (We think) you got it.
